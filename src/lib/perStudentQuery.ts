/**
 * Centralised per-student query helper for the parent dashboard.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ───────────────
 * Teacher and principal dashboards write per-student docs (attendance,
 * test_scores, gradebook_scores, assignments/submissions, parent_notes,
 * principal_to_parent_notes, risks, results, etc.) with TWO identifying
 * fields: `studentId` AND `studentEmail`.
 *
 * The parent's `studentData.id` is the `students/{doc_id}` Firestore ID,
 * resolved by AuthContext from the signed-in user's email. But teacher /
 * principal write paths don't always carry that exact studentId — some
 * legacy and partial enrollments end up with a different value in the
 * `studentId` field, while `studentEmail` is always correct.
 *
 * Result: a single-query read by `studentId` silently misses docs that
 * the same student CAN see by email. Live verified 2026-05-01: the
 * attendance page returned 1 doc by studentId vs 15 by studentEmail for
 * the same student.
 *
 * THE PATTERN
 * ───────────
 * For every per-student read, set up TWO `onSnapshot` listeners:
 *   - One scoped query by `studentId`
 *   - One scoped query by `studentEmail` (lowercased)
 * Merge both snapshot caches by Firestore doc id (Map keyed on `d.id`)
 * before handing them to the UI. Cleanup unsubscribes both.
 *
 * USAGE
 * ─────
 *   // Live subscription (use in useEffect):
 *   const unsub = subscribePerStudent({
 *     collection: "attendance",
 *     student: studentData,
 *     filters: [where("date", ">=", "2025-06-01")],
 *     onChange: (docs) => setLogs(docs),
 *   });
 *   return () => unsub();
 *
 *   // One-shot fetch:
 *   const docs = await fetchPerStudent({
 *     collection: "results",
 *     student: studentData,
 *     filters: [where("date", ">=", weekStart)],
 *   });
 *
 * SEE ALSO
 * ────────
 * - `subscribeEnrollments` in `enrollmentQuery.ts` is the older single-
 *   purpose version of this pattern. Both use the same merge logic.
 * - Memory file `dual_query_pattern_studentid_email.md` documents the
 *   project-wide rule.
