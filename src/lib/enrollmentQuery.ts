/**
 * Centralised enrollment query for the parent dashboard.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * Some teacher/principal-dashboard code paths historically wrote
 * `enrollments.studentId = email` instead of the actual student doc ID.
 * Newer writes use the real Firestore doc ID. We need parent-dashboard reads
 * to match BOTH formats so legacy enrollments (those created before the
 * teacher/principal write fix) keep showing up — without requiring a data
 * migration.
 *
 * Strategy: subscribe to TWO scoped queries (one by studentId, one by
 * studentEmail), merge results by doc.id, and forward to a single callback.
 * Returns a single unsubscribe function that tears both listeners down.
